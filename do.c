/* i working with this code and a lot of things seemed confusing at first.
 * but from the looks of things this code seems to be telling my computer "if me is greater than the given number, minus one and print out".however, why does it seem to give me something i dont understand when i say "if me is less than the given  number, minus one and print out e.g (me<89); me--;"
 * this means that 
 * int me = 25;
 * do { 
 * printf("%d\n", me); me++;
 * }
 * while (me<72);
 * return 0;
 * }
